              The peacock rulers of <i>Gongmen City</i> invent fireworks, but their son, Lord Shen, puts the gunpowder to 
              evil use. Overhearing a prophecy that a "warrior of black and white" will defeat him if he continues, 
              Shen destroys the local giant panda population. Horrified by the genocide, Shen's parents banish him. 
              Some decades later, Shen and his wolf army start to raid villages for scrap metal.
              Meanwhile, Po is enjoying his new role as a Kung Fu Master alongside the Furious Five, though Master 
              Shifu warns him he has not yet achieved inner peace. When the Wolf Boss raids the Musicians' Village, 
              Po and the Five intercept him; however, a symbol on his armor gives Po a flashback of his mother. Po
              confronts his father Mr. Ping, and the goose reveals that he found Po, as an infant, in a shipment of 
              radishes outside his restaurant. When no one came forward to claim the cub, Ping adopted Po as his son.

              For hundreds of years, sea monsters have surfaced to wreak havoc against mankind. In response, sailors 
              venture outward on their ships to hunt the beasts across the ocean, the most famous of these being 
              the crew of "The Inevitable"; led by the legendary Captain Crow, his first mate Sarah Sharpe, and his 
              adopted son Jacob Holland. They are financially backed by the King and Queen of The Crown, who have 
              established a distinguished society dubbed Three Bridges. After being nearly killed during a hunt, 
              Crow tells Jacob that he will make him captain once they kill a female beast known as the Red Bluster 
              that took his eye.

              The viking <i>Village of Berk</i> is frequently attacked by dragons, which steal livestock and endanger 
              the villagers. Hiccup, the awkward fifteen-year-old son of the village chieftain, Stoick the Vast, 
              is deemed too weak to fight the dragons. Instead, he creates mechanical devices under his apprenticeship 
              with Gobber, the village blacksmith, though Hiccup's inventions often backfire. Hiccup uses a bolas 
              launcher to shoot down a Night Fury, a rare and dangerous dragon, but cannot bring himself to kill 
              the creature and sets him free.
